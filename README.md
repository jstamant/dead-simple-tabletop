# Dead-Simple Tabletop

Welcome to the repository for Dead-Simple Tabletop!

...I'd like to upload some screenshots when I have something screenshot-worthy...

## Features

There are no features implemented as of yet.

## Roadmap

Here's a general list of features I'd like to implement in this platform, roughly ordered by priority.

- Sign-up
- Password login
- Email code login
- Create character sheets
- Create templates
- Create games/tables
- Invite/add users to tables
- Link sharing for tables - no sign-up required for players
- In-game dice roller

Low priority:

- Character sheet export to PDF
- Payment and/or tipping

## Technologies

On the frontend, I'll be using React.

On the backend, I'll be using Rust.

For the DBMS, I'll be using PostgreSQL.

For the frontend within games/tables, I think I might use WebGL, which might be a better choice for VTT features down the line, like the dice-roller. But I might equally just use React for simplicity, to start.
